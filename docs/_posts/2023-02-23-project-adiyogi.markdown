## Project ADIYOGI

### Step 1: Review day prior and plan day forth

"a ship never leaves port without a destination (in evening plan all)" (have as quote from the dude; and this is as motivation for why you plan course)

**In the evening:**

- **review the day**
- **time block the next day**

When reviewing day:

- Seneca has a quote about this.

When time-blocking:

- for all hours set a rule "this or nothing"
- as "this" set tasks reduced to ones accomplishable today
- as "nothing" can allow specific pieces of content for some parts of the day (prob not in AM... yes in PM)

### Step 2: Go to sleep

Go to sleep. Sleep enough.

Then you can start thinking about doing things. You'll also be more able to do things. And to not be distracted. Good shit.

Do not fall into comfort seeking. That would just be running away from pain, which leads to suffering. **Sit on the floor in discomfort, fall through the pain, until you reach the infinite loving core.** Use sight and consciousness.

### Step 3: Move immediately

Have first steps clear (back in step 1). Have first steps prepped (forth in step 5).

Since I have difficulty starting moving, **pack gym stuff night before** and just **GTFO of the house ASAP** and go to the gym. That is a good default. When able, try working immediately, or maybe just short walks.

Example default:

- drink glass of water left at the window
- put on trainers
- pee
- brush teeth
- out the door with the gym bag

### Step 4: Do or do not

> control attention, control action
> <div style="text-align: right"> - can't find source... me? fat chance </div>

Either do the action in the plan, or do nothing.

To persevere, who are you persevering for (now or in the future).

Meditate daily on that which is larger than life, to then be able to play life with humor, knowing that each task is a mirage of necessity.

When tired, options for recharging are:

- walk
- stretch
- exercise (quick BW)
- nap
- masturbate (no visual stimulus)
- shower
- tidy, clean
- meditate
    - 13 min focus medit
    - WHM
    - on that which is larger than life

All can be 15min and without a screen (list taken from Niels blog).

Don't spike dopamine prior or after effort, learn to spike it from effort itself. Meaning no YT as reward.

Can try a long midday nap if energy is gone (and to potentially be able to sleep less than 11 hours during the night...).

### Step 5: Prepare; take care of the yourself of tomorrow

Example default:

- pour him water and place it by the window
- prepare and pick his clothes
- pack the gym bag
- tidy surfaces
- ...

Take care of yourself as you would for someone you care about.
