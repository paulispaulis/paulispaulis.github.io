# From Cowards to Conquerors: The Power of Courage to Overcome Procrastination and Find Purpose

## Chapter 1. The Dance of the Frightened

> The coward’s complexion will always keep changing hue, his inner thoughts never are calm, won’t let him sit still, he shifts from ham to ham, puts his weight on either foot; but the brave man’s complexion’s unchanging.
> 
>  –  words spoken by Idomeneus, leader of Kretans, to Mērionēs in Homer's Iliad

Fear breeds delay. The restless twitching of a coward is a sign of an unsettled mind. But constant movement is not a virtue. We often find ourselves in a maelstrom of tasks and responsibilities, hopping from one to another, seeking refuge in distractions in our fleeting moments of rest. This relentless cycle of busyness and distraction can lead to a life of regret, where we grow old and bitter, realizing that we have not accomplished anything of real worth. This is the snare of the restless mind, constantly moving but making no real progress.

> For love of bustle is not industry, it is only the restlessness of a hunted mind. 
> True repose does not consist in condemning all motion as merely vexation, that kind of repose is slackness and inertia.
> The work of the philosopher is finding the perfect balance; working and relaxing, not working and work avoidance.
> – Seneca

Imagine a life where instead of mindless busyness, every action is clear, deliberate, purposeful. Imagine having control over your attention and, as a result, your actions. This is the life I refer to as "Adiyogi", named after the first yogi who was always either in ecstatic dance or absolute stillness. A figure of immense wisdom, tranquility, and clarity. A symbol of self-realisation and enlightenment. It is about being in a state of heightened awareness and understanding, where one's actions naturally align with the fundamental nature of existence.

> You two Aiases, leaders of the bronze-corseleted Achaians
> to you – out of place to urge you – I give no orders:
> you yourselves are exhorting your men to battle fiercely!
> If only – by Zeus the father, by Athène and Apollo! –
> such a spirit might be engendered in every man’s heart,
> then would King Priam’s city soon totter to its fall,
> stormed and sacked at our hands.
> 
> – Homer, Iliad

Heroes are not those who require orders or persuasion. They are aware of the task at hand and prepare accordingly.

They are the embodiment of the Adiyogi spirit, moving with purpose and clarity. Within each of us exists this voice of inner wisdom, often drowned out by the clamor of fear and procrastination.

The voice of guilt within us shows that we understand what needs to be done. The real question is, do you possess the courage to act on it?

Often, what you need isn't new knowledge, but a reminder of what you already know. I write this letter as a reminder to myself, now and whenever I find myself lost again, of what the world is all about. Welcome aboard! I hope you disembark slightly sexier.

## Chapter 2. The Twin Traps of Procrastination

> There are two reasons why we procrastinate:
> - we hold ourselves to excessively high standards
> - we hold ourselves to excessively low standards
> Both are bad, as they do not correspond to reality.
> – Niels Bohrmann

Excessive standards can immobilize us. We become so focused on achieving perfection that we forget that growth is not dependent on perfection, but on the accumulation of results. Whether we win or lose, we grow. The key is to act, to not let the fear of failure or the pursuit of perfection hinder our progress.

> Acquired strength is dictated by the accumulation of results. To suffer defeat or experience victory – we grow regardless.
> – Todo, from Jujutsu Kaisen (put in panel not quote?)

It's far too easy to fall into the trap of waiting for the perfect plan or the perfect moment. Fear of making a mistake can freeze us in our tracks. Instead, we must stride forward with confidence. Even if the step is wrong, we'll know it and be better prepared for the next.

> do not wait
> act
>  your uniqueness reveals itself through your actions, your choices
>   not by waiting. 
>   waiting is not unique.
>   
>   – visakanv tweet (can link it)

On the other side of the spectrum, we find the pitfall of setting our standards too low, where we fail to see the significance of our actions and, over-obsessed with the self, lose sight of the grander scheme of life. Viktor Frankl, an esteemed psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor, provides valuable insight on how to avoid this trap.

> The true meaning of life is to be discovered in the world rather than within man or his psyche. “The self-transcendence of human existence” – being human always points to something / someone other than oneself, a meaning to fulfil or person to encounter. The more one forgets oneself – serving a cause or loving a person – the more human he is and the more he actualises himself.
>  Self-actualisation is possible only as a side-effect of self-transcendence.
>  
>  – Viktor Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning

Frankl posits that the true meaning of life is not found within ourselves, but within the world around us. By dedicating ourselves to a cause or loving a person, we transcend our individual existence and actualise our human potential.

> What man needs is not homeostasis but noo-dynamics, i.e. the existential dynamics in a polar field of tension where one pole is the meaning to be fulfilled and the other is the man who has to fulfil it.
> It is a dangerous misconception that what is needed for mental hygiene is equilibrium or homeostasis. ***Don't be hesitant to challenge a man with a potential meaning***, to thus evoke his will to meaning.
> 
> – Viktor Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning

Going further, Frankl advocates for an embrace of existential *tension*. The drive towards meaning is inherently human. Not static balance. Challenge yourself, find meaning, ignite.

> Don't aim at success – the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. ***For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue***, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one's dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself.
> ***Listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge.*** Then you will live to see that in the long run – in the long run, I say! – success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think of it.
> 
> – Viktor Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning

Finally, Frankl warns against the direct pursuit of success. *Listen to your conscience, follow its commands to the best of your ability.* Do this long enough and success will follow, unintended.

In conclusion, whether our standards are excessively high or depressingly low, the key to overcoming procrastination lies in finding meaning in our actions and executing them regardless of the outcome. Only then can we truly grow and die with more than just "potential" carved on our tombstones.

## Chapter 3. The Inner Odyssey: From Fear to Fortitude

> God will not have his work made manifest by cowards.
> 
> – Ralph Waldo Emerson, Self-Reliance

The greatness that reverberates through the annals of Greek epics does not spring from weakness. It demands a monstrous strength, an inner power that transcends the ordinary. This strength, once harnessed, must be wielded with virtue and purpose, much like the heroes of ancient Greece, the Achaeans. The following excerpts from the Iliad poignantly illustrate this point. They are not merely tales of valor and conquest, but profound allegories of the human spirit and its limitless potential.

In the first excerpt, we witness the strength and courage of Menelaös.

> As a man cultivates an olive tree's flourishing slip
> in a lonely spot, where spring water wells up in abundance-
> a fine, healthy sapling, and breezes from every quarter
> make it shiver, and soon it bursts out in white blossom,
> but then a sudden gale comes, with abundance of storm winds,
> tears it up root and all and lays it out flat on the ground:
> in such wise Pánthoos's son, the ashen-speared Euphorbos,
> was slain by Atreus's son Menelaös, stripped of his armor.
> As some mountain-bred lion, confident in its strength,
> from a grazing herd snatches a cow, the best one there-
> when he's caught her, he first breaks her neck with his powerful teeth,
> then gulps down her blood, along with all her innards,
> tearing her flesh, while all round him hunting dogs and herdsmen
> make much noise, but from a distance, not being minded
> to confront him, for pale fear has them in its grip:
> just so the heart in the breast of no Trojan dared
> to come out and confront illustrious Menelaös.
> 
> – Homer, Iliad

The second excerpt describes the shouts of Achilles, the legendary Greek hero.

> There he stood, and shouted-and Athène, standing apart,
> gave voice too--arousing vast panic among the Trojans.
> As clear as the trumpet's note sounds out when a township's
> encircled by enemies with destruction on their minds,
> so clear was the war cry uttered by Aiakos's grandson: when
> the Trojans heard that brazen voice, and knew its author,
> the spirits of all were confounded. The fine-maned horses
> turned their chariots backwards, sensing trouble ahead;
> their charioteers were in panic when they saw the tireless fire
> blaze marvelously over the head of Peleus's great-hearted son-
> a fire lit and kept shining by the goddess, grey-eyed Athène.
> Three great shouts over the ditch did noble Achilles give,
> and three times the Trojans and their far-famed allies panicked:
> twelve of their finest fighters perished there and then,
> among their own spears and chariots.
> 
> – Homer, Iliad

While these tales may seem steeped in violence and aggression, they are, at their essence, narratives of strength and resilience. Even the biblical concept of 'meekness' is not an endorsement of weakness, but a testament to the power of choice. Only when one possesses the strength to retaliate, the power to fight back, can they *choose* not to. You can't sheathe a sword you don't possess.

> You have heard that it was said, "Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth." But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.
> – Matthew 5:38
> And then my pastor said something that has stuck with me ever since. "People misunderstand this, they think you are supposed to revel in your weakness. But the only way you can truly turn the other cheek is if you know you could destroy the other person. You must develop the potential for violence first to then decide against it."
> – Niels Bohrmann

What I advocate here is not brute force or blind aggression. It's about strength, courage, and confidence, but of a kind that is purposeful and compassionate. It's about harnessing your inner power and using it to make a difference.

> {Aineias charged straight at Idomeneus.}
> Idomeneus was not seized by panic, like some youngster, but waited, as when a boar in the mountains, **trusting his strength**, makes ready to fight off {attacks}.
> – Homer, Iliad

This is the kind of courage that is the antithesis of procrastination, of leg-bouncing and fidgeting. It's about trusting in your strengths, preparing yourself for the battle ahead. It's about embracing the necessary monster within and using it to conquer your fears and achieve your goals.

## Chapter 4. The Eternal Echoes of Heroism

While we often associate epic tales and heroes with the ancient past, it's crucial to understand that the quest for a meaningful life, worthy of an epic poem, isn't confined to the ancient Greek era. A compelling example can be found in the writings of Viktor Frankl, a Holocaust survivor.

> We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in numbers, but they offer sufficient proof that ***everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms – to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.***
> 
> – Viktor Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning

This quote illustrates that heroism does not require grand gestures or monumental achievements. It can be found in the smallest of actions, in the quietest of moments, and in the most desperate of circumstances. When stripped of all material possessions and personal freedoms, individuals can still choose their attitude and their response to their situation. This capacity for choice, even in the face of extreme adversity, is a testament to the indomitable spirit of humanity.

> Thirdly, the short time I have been married to her outweighs everything, even all we have gone through here.
> 
> Otto, where are you now? Are you alive? What has happened to you since our last hour together? Did you find your wife again? And do you remember how I made you learn my will by heart – word for word – in spite of your childlike tears?
> 
> – Viktor Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning

When we juxtapose the grandeur of the ancient Greeks with the recent horrors of Auschwitz, we are struck by how close we are in time to such atrocities. Yet, how painfully beautiful are the texts that emerged from this dark period in history.

In our time, we witness modern epics unfold before our eyes. UFC 278, August 2022. In the co-main event, Luke Rockhold, the elder fighter, paints his bloody face on his opponent's in the final minute of a losing fight. A gory spectacle of resilience.

But the main event tells a true epic. Leon "Rocky" Edwards, born in crime-ridden Birmingham, escapes his circumstances through martial arts training, fighting. Despite success, he stays loyal to his coaches, his gym, his country. After hardships in getting to the championship opportunity, he finally faces Kamaru Usman, a dominant champion, rated number one greatest pound-for-pound fighter alive, who defeated him years before. The odds are against him. Thus unfold the first four rounds and four minutes of the final fifth. But in the last minute of the last round, after a stirring speech from his corner, Edwards knocks Usman out cold with a head-kick.

> Pound-for-pound. BANG. Headshot. Dead.
> – Leon "The Rocky" Edwards, UFC 278 post fight interview.

Leon "Rocky" Edwards, still in the cage, crafts his story, writes poems, in real-time. His tale, a reminder that epics and heroes are not relics of the past, but live in our world today.

## Chapter 5: A Framework for Action

Now, we translate the stories of heroes into a framework for action. A guide towards a life of purpose, courage, and meaningful action.

**Step 1: Finding Your Purpose**

Consider Frankl's words: "The true meaning of life is to be discovered in the world rather than within man or his psyche." Explore your world, find causes that stir you, people who inspire you. Your purpose lies where your passions, skills, and the world's needs meet. ***Go. Try. Do. See.***

**Step 2: Setting Your Standards**

Recall Niels Bohrmann's warning about the twin traps of procrastination - standards too high or too low. Set standards that challenge, but don't paralyse. That inspire, but don't breed complacency.

***How to do this?***

Dr. K suggests:
- take a minute,
- sit straight (as if a string pulls you up by the top of your head),
- chant an inner "ohm / aum" three times to feel your inner vibrations,
- realise, you are not the standard, high or low. You are you, with a task to do.

Let your emotions be ones that drive you to action and growth.

**Step 3: Cultivating Inner Strength**

Draw from the courage of Homer's heroes. Develop inner strength, not for aggression, but to make a difference. This strength will help you face fears, overcome procrastination, and act decisively towards your goals.

***For this, cultivate:***
- physical strength, for stability in this world,
- bravery by facing increasing challenges (start where you can, growth will follow),
- mental resilience, showing yourself that you are more than your thoughts, and that the inner you cannot be shaken.

**Step 4: Embracing the Power of Choice**

Like the heroes in Frankl's concentration camp stories, remember that ***you always have the power to choose your attitude and response***, regardless of circumstances. This power of choice is a testament to the indomitable spirit of humanity and a crucial tool in your journey towards a meaningful life.

**Step 5: Taking Action**

Now, embark on your own hero's journey. The journey is as important as the destination. Embrace challenges, learn from failures, and celebrate victories. Be a good gardener, nurturing your growth and the growth of those around you.

Finally, act. I leave you with the words of Ye (Kanye):

> You are a being with engineering opportunities before you.

Do you have the courage to seize them? The world awaits your answer.

Be a good gardener,

Paulis
