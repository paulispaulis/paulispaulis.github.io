GOLD DRAFT

ROUGH CONTENT


**The Natural Order of Money by Roy Sebag**

money should be attached to reality. if it is not – the economy will fail from abstraction. there is a natural order to money, when attached to reality. gold is king.

what to do with this info? are cryptos defo bad? (mby smth like that when RB holds gold and for transactions less than 60eur we give crypto... is that still crypto? gold backed...)

> It also requires that we view **ideation**, which is the trade of the service economy, **as always and everywhere accountable to the real economy.**
> p24

^^ dejās un zinātnē un blogā, be accountable to the real economy. Making happy farmers through dance and practical philosophy. (iespējams tas man irko par dažiem online marketing gurus... dan koe (un mby bet laikm mazāk hamza) izliekas par dūžiem bet viņi spēlē šķiet to un-accountable spēli... (mby tik ka izklaidē the masses ar vids. bet to apmaksā advertisers... un tur man liekas atkal ir gļuks)

> What follows from ignoring this reality is an unnatural view of prosperity as something which can be mastered, determined, and distributed according to the personal desires and subjective ideals of the service economy.
> p28

^^ šis varētu būt kas noved / hinto uz manu novērojum intuīciju par online "burbuli" ... detached from reality, cajoled real economy into serving us, tad dzen naudu pa riņķi

> **By anchoring** economic activity **to the natural standard** of measure and reward, we place **less emphasis on the personal desire to own something** for its own sake over long periods of time, and instead **place a greater emphasis on the collective desire to cooperate sustainably.**
> p36

^^ ja man stāv koks aiz šķūņa, man nav īsti vēlme tam tur vnk stāvēt... riktīgi labprāt došu čomam kurš grib uzbūvēt šķūni priekš vistu turēšanas! (pret subscription to eggs ofc ;) ). VS nauda gan man labprāt prost stāvēs jo hujzin ko tur darīt... bet šis laikam ir tīri psiholoģiski. vai šādi vaibi scaleojas uz lielām lietām? invest in a chicken farm??

> Thus, **in a generative cycle**, a growing **surplus** of energy **embodiments will exist relative to the gold** money, **signalling** the state of **abundance** from nature **and** the carrying **capacity to support an expansion of service economic activities**. Conversely, **in a degenerative cycle**, a **diminishing** surplus of energy **embodiments** will exist **relative to the gold** money, **signalling** a state of **deficiency** from nature and the **need to realign economic activity towards the real economy**.

^^ tātad viņš piedāvā nevis monetary policy & central banks groza kloķus, bet ka Gaia pati visu darīs? kinda cool if it works. tasks daru pēc mēness fāzēm, monetary policy pēc Gaia
***KO ŠIS dara ar savings. jo tas bija tas kur visam cenu maiņa didnt do enough.

> Having ignored ecological accountability, the economist and anthropologist take the overproduction of energy embodiments for granted, as if it were the default state of cooperation. In this imaginary world where the products of the real economy are assumed to exist in a perpetual state of overproduction, the two schools then quarrel over *how* (exchange markets vs. altruism) and *why* (invisible hand vs. moral obligations) these energy embodiments move from the one segment of society to the other.

IMPO ASPECT: part of why gold better than money is that gold has an inherent usefulness; its worth isn't just that it is money, someone will need it to build and do things as well

^^ tas inherent value gan šķietami ierobežots?

does gold have any inherent value? what would the price of gold be if it was only used as a commodity?

As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions, but here is the answer to your question:

***Yes, gold has inherent value as it is a valuable and rare precious metal that is used in various applications, including jewelry, electronics, medicine, aerospace, and more. Gold has been used as a form of currency for thousands of years and is considered a "safe haven" asset that investors turn to during times of economic uncertainty.***

***If gold was only used as a commodity and not for its investment value, its price would likely depend on supply and demand factors, such as the amount of gold available for sale and the demand for gold in various industries. It is difficult to predict the exact price, as it would fluctuate based on market conditions. However, it is worth noting that gold's high value and rarity would likely keep its price relatively high even if it was only used as a commodity.***

**Operation Fortune by Guy Ritchie**

baddies' plan – buy much gold; use AI weapon to have banking system glitch, destroying all trust; everyone turns to gold because that is the only option remaining for xxx.

did guy ritchie chat w Roy Sebag? did someone listen to the plan and started implementing it??

**Silicon Valley bank failures and Swiss Bank struggles**

then headlines start popping up – silicon valley bank closures. ominous with this context, but over the pond.

then swiss bank struggles... this shit is starting to be too close for comfort...

sooooo bought some gold... PIC



**Goldmoney research**

> Therefore, in our view, the only reason for gold prices to detach from the underlying variables in our model by such a large amount and for such a long time is that the gold market finally starts pricing in that there is a risk central banks, particularly the Fed, are losing control over inflation, which is remarkable given the prevailing narrative that the Fed is willing and able to do whatever it takes to bring inflation under control.

***> speedy payment is pushed forward while the act of settlement is delayed. [..] a group of friends sitting in a circle pass around a melting ice cube: with each turn, the ice cube is fundamentally changed, and eventually it disappears altogether. With these monetary subsitutes, the party receiving the money in any transaction is not left with an equitable measurement, a just reward, or even a lasting store of value***

^^ settlement comes only when you've gotten hold of something. fiat money doesn't really do it... as you only hold a promise; and quite the shit one at that... (inflation and tbh any of the monetary manipulations). so the obsession with transaction speeds is weird... as the actual source of sorrow is lack of settlement. goldmoney proposes that gold would feel as settlement. since it is a real thing. it can still change in value relative to goods depending on how many goods are in the season. but that makes sense and is connected to reality (droughts and whatever).

### GPT-4 answers

**should money be gold?**

The question of whether money should be backed by gold or other precious metals is a matter of economic debate. Advocates of the gold standard argue that it can help maintain stable currency value, limit inflation, and encourage fiscal discipline. Critics, however, contend that it can lead to deflationary pressures, limit economic growth, and make monetary policy inflexible.

Historically, money was often backed by gold or other precious metals, but most countries abandoned the gold standard in the 20th century in favor of fiat currencies. Fiat money is not backed by a physical commodity, but rather by the trust and confidence in the government that issues it. This approach allows for more flexible monetary policy and the ability to respond to economic fluctuations.

Ultimately, whether or not money should be gold depends on one's views on the trade-offs between the stability provided by a gold-backed currency and the flexibility offered by a fiat currency.


**how do i start using gold as money in a world where fiat currencies are the norm?**

Using gold as money in a world dominated by fiat currencies is not straightforward, but there are several ways you can incorporate gold into your financial transactions and investments. Here are some options:

1. Physical gold: You can purchase gold bars or coins from reputable dealers and store them securely. While using physical gold for everyday transactions is not practical, it can serve as a long-term store of value and a hedge against inflation.

2. Gold-backed digital currencies: Some digital currencies are backed by physical gold, with each unit representing a specific amount of gold. These can be used for transactions or as an investment vehicle. Examples include PAX Gold (PAXG) and Tether Gold (XAUT).

3. Gold ETFs and ETNs: Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and exchange-traded notes (ETNs) are investment products that track the price of gold. These can be bought and sold on stock exchanges like regular shares, making it easier to gain exposure to gold without owning the physical asset.

4. Gold mining stocks: Investing in companies involved in gold mining or production is another way to gain exposure to gold prices. This can be done through individual stocks or gold-focused mutual funds.

5. Gold certificates and accounts: Some banks and financial institutions offer gold certificates or gold accounts that allow you to buy, sell, and store gold without physically possessing it. These accounts can simplify the process of investing in gold and may offer additional security.

6. Local trade and barter: In some communities, people may be open to trading goods and services using gold as a medium of exchange. This is more likely in small, tight-knit communities or among those who share an interest in alternative currencies.

Keep in mind that using gold as money comes with its own set of challenges, such as storage, security, and limited acceptance. Additionally, tax implications and regulations regarding gold transactions may vary depending on your location. It's important to research and understand the legal and financial aspects of using gold as money before making any decisions.

**alt answer to same Q**

Using gold as money in a world dominated by fiat currencies can be challenging, but there are ways to incorporate gold into your financial transactions. Here are some steps you can take:

1. Purchase physical gold: You can buy gold in the form of coins, bars, or bullion from reputable dealers. Make sure to store your gold securely, either in a safe deposit box or a private storage facility.

2. Use gold-backed debit cards: Some financial institutions offer gold-backed debit cards, which allow you to hold gold in an account and spend it like fiat currency. These cards automatically convert the gold value into the local currency when making transactions.

3. Trade in gold-based cryptocurrencies: There are several digital currencies backed by gold, such as PAX Gold (PAXG) and Tether Gold (XAUT). You can buy, sell, and trade these digital assets on various cryptocurrency exchanges. These tokens are typically redeemable for physical gold if desired.

4. Engage with local communities: Find or create a community of like-minded individuals who are also interested in using gold as money. This could be through online forums, social media groups, or local meetups. You can then engage in barter or trade using gold with others in the community.

5. Support businesses that accept gold: Some businesses, especially online retailers, may accept gold as a form of payment. Seek out these businesses and support them to encourage the use of gold in commerce.

6. Advocate for gold as money: Educate others about the benefits of using gold as a form of currency and encourage wider acceptance. This could involve writing articles, speaking at events, or engaging in local political discussions.

Remember that using gold as money in everyday transactions may not be practical or widely accepted. It's essential to be aware of local laws and regulations, as well as any tax implications, when using gold in financial transactions.


**what are some interesting questions to explore regarding using gold as money in the modern world?**

Exploring the use of gold as money in the modern world can lead to several interesting questions. Some of these include:

1. What are the economic implications of returning to a gold standard? How would it impact inflation, deflation, and global trade?

2. How would a gold-backed currency affect the flexibility and effectiveness of monetary policy? Would central banks be able to respond to economic crises as effectively?

3. What would be the environmental impact of increased gold mining if demand for gold as money were to rise significantly? How can sustainable mining practices be encouraged?

4. How can gold be integrated into digital payment systems and cryptocurrencies to create a more stable and secure form of money?

5. What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of using gold as money for developing countries with unstable currencies? How might it affect their economic growth and development?

6. How would the use of gold as money influence the distribution of wealth and income inequality within and between nations?

7. What are the potential risks associated with using gold as money, such as theft, fraud, and counterfeit production? How can these risks be mitigated?

8. How would the use of gold as money affect the global financial system, including international reserves, exchange rates, and capital flows?

9. What are the legal and regulatory challenges of using gold as money, and how can they be addressed?

10. How can public awareness and acceptance of gold as a form of currency be increased, and what role do education and advocacy play in this process?

These questions can lead to thought-provoking discussions and research, offering insights into the feasibility and consequences of using gold as money in the modern world.


**would there even be economic crises that need monetary policy, if we used gold as money?**

Using gold as money, or returning to a gold standard, might not eliminate economic crises entirely. Economic crises can arise from various factors beyond just monetary policy, such as fluctuations in demand, supply shocks, financial market disruptions, and geopolitical events. While a gold standard could impose certain constraints on monetary policy and potentially reduce some types of economic instability, it is unlikely to completely prevent crises.

Under a gold standard, the money supply is tied to the amount of gold available. This can lead to several limitations and potential issues:

1. Limited flexibility: Central banks would have less ability to adjust the money supply or interest rates in response to economic fluctuations, which could make it more difficult to stabilize the economy during downturns or periods of high inflation.

2. Deflationary pressures: A gold standard can result in deflationary pressures if the supply of gold does not keep up with economic growth. Deflation can lead to lower consumer spending, reduced investment, and ultimately, economic stagnation or recession.

3. Exchange rate instability: Under a gold standard, exchange rates are determined by the relative gold content of different currencies. This can lead to exchange rate fluctuations if gold production or discoveries vary significantly between countries, potentially causing imbalances in trade and capital flows.

4. Vulnerability to speculative attacks: A gold standard can make economies more vulnerable to speculative attacks on their currencies, particularly if there is a perceived imbalance between the gold reserves and the amount of currency in circulation.

5. Dependence on gold production: The overall health of the economy would be closely tied to the production and availability of gold. This dependence could create vulnerabilities to factors such as mining disruptions, geopolitical tensions, or resource depletion.

In summary, while a gold standard might impose some discipline on monetary policy and potentially reduce certain types of economic instability, it is unlikely to completely eliminate economic crises. The inherent limitations and risks associated with using gold as money could, in some cases, contribute to or exacerbate crises rather than prevent them.


### texas might release gold backed digital currency

COPIED

from https://oilprice.com/Metals/Gold/Texas-May-Launch-Its-Own-Gold-backed-Digital-Currency.html

> Impact

> The creation of a state-issued gold-backed digital currency would create currency competition with Federal Reserve notes and undermine the Fed’s monopoly on money. It would also provide an alternative if the Federal Reserve implements a central bank digital currency.

> Broadly speaking, by making gold conveniently available for regular, daily transactions by the general public, gold-backed digital currency would create the potential for a wide-reaching effect. Professor William Greene, an expert on constitutional tender, said in a paper for the Mises Institute that when people in multiple states actually start using gold instead of Federal Reserve notes, it would effectively nullify the Federal Reserve and end the federal government’s monopoly on money.

> “Over time, as residents of the state use both Federal Reserve notes and silver and gold coins, the fact that the coins hold their value more than Federal Reserve notes do will lead to a ‘reverse Gresham’s Law’ effect, where good money (gold and silver coins) will drive out bad money (Federal Reserve notes).

> “As this happens, a cascade of events can begin to occur, including the flow of real wealth toward the state’s treasury, an influx of banking business from outside of the state – as people in other states carry out their desire to bank with sound money – and an eventual outcry against the use of Federal Reserve notes for any transactions.”

> Gresham’s Law holds that “bad money drives out good.”  For example, when the U.S. government replaced silver quarters and dimes with coins made primarily of less valuable copper, the cheap coins drove the silver out of circulation. People hoarded the more valuable silver coins and spent the less valuable copper money. So, how do you reverse Gresham?

> The key is in making it easier to use gold in everyday transactions. The reason bad money drives out good is that governments put up barriers to using sound money in day-to-day life. That makes it more costly to spend gold and incentivizes hoarding. When you remove barriers, you level the playing field and allow gold and silver to compete head-to-head with Federal Reserve notes. On an even playing field, gold beats fiat money every time.

### chat gpt on global trade

what will happen to global trade in a gold backed currency world, where countries struggling to compete wont be able to devalue their currency?

In a gold-backed currency world, global trade would be more stable and predictable as there would be less currency fluctuations. However, countries struggling to compete would not be able to devalue their currency to increase their competitiveness, which could lead to a greater divide between richer and poorer nations. It could also result in protectionist policies, such as tariffs and trade barriers, as countries would try to protect their industries and businesses from foreign competition. Overall, the impact on global trade would depend on how countries and global institutions adapt to the new currency system.

# ATTEMPT TO ORDER:

Something feels off about money...
Partially a review of Roy Sebag's "The Natural Order of Money"

## something has seemed off and fake (try to word it so it pulls)

For some years now I've had a nagging feeling that something feels off in how money is presented, both in the default slowlane of go to uni and get a job, as well as in the social media popular make money quick through online marketing type of approaches.

In the former I see two holes. First, everyone rewards going to university too much. Everyone seems happy and proud about people spending innumerous years at uni, allowing them not to do too many real things at all... Maybe get some graduate position in the background, but fine to jump around only earning entry level salaries and not doing much.

And when the balance does shift to mainly working, there we arrive at the second hole – once covid hit it seemed fine that most of the working people were put on the sidelines, doing only fractions of their work or nothing at all... And the government just gives handouts and we get talks of universal basic incomes and the like... Feels like an admittance that the positions aren't needed and are only there to keep people busy and they can start slowly repaying their student loans. I am likely biased from the sphere I am in – research assistant at a university, where my salary is paid by government (state or EU) projects, but companies don't really want to invest any resources. Then most of the game is just writing proper project proposals, getting the money, writing some publications so that project obligation quotas are filled, and then repeat, with no regard to whether anyone needs anything that has been accomplished. Feels empty.

Then the popular alternative that I've noticed – make money online! Dropshipping, online marketing, etc. Either sell things that people don't need but will accidentaly buy, or online marketing, which feels dubious seeing how much of watch-time is 9yo that won't buy the things (or at least not with their own money). I don't see too much value creation here either, but it still seems rewarded.

## Humanity has detached from reality // sebag gave an answer that felt correct! (disconnection from reality) (relisten to podcast? and write down bits?)

COPIED
In comes Roy Sebag, who I first heard as a guest on Jordan Peterson's podcast, then bought and read his book; he sets a hypothesis that humanity has become too detached from reality. He splits the economy into real and service, where the real interacts with the earth to produce a surplus of energy embodiments (food, fuel, or materials), while the service is a net consumer of these, and can logically only exist while the real economy supports it. But the world we live in today is ruled by the service economy and it has somehow taken the real economy hostage, having them produce the surplus we assume as guaranteed, and then the majority fuck around within the service economy, purposeless and unaccountable.

He suggests
  
> that we view **ideation**, which is the trade of the service economy, **as always and everywhere accountable to the real economy.**
> p24

A simple way to think of this would be whether the farmer (some member of the real economy) would be willing to part with his produced surplus for what you are giving him. To take myself as an example, I do AI research and dance; how should I conduct myself in these, so that the farmer would be willing to share with his surplus? The AI research ought to lead to something down the line usable and helpful, hopefully achieving something more than only publications with useless code. For dance, I think one important aspect is to not make it too alien to the farmer. One of my favourite reviews for a concert I participated in recently was that it was for the audience member

> the first contemporary dance concert, where I understood everything.
> // izraksti precizak //

It included a compliment and a diagnosis – modern contemporary dance has grown away from the farmer, it doesn't tell stories that he can relate to or understand; who is it for? Some circle jerk of the service economy? Meanwhile looking down at the farmer who doesn't understand?

This example was more to do with the purpose of activities, but it also relates to the overall economy; we've grown to ignore the accountability we have to the earth and time, that we need this perpetual cooperation to function and survive; we've allowed ourselves to forget that survival isn't guaranteed, someone is always working to ensure it for you.

> What follows from ignoring this reality is an unnatural view of prosperity as something which can be mastered, determined, and distributed according to the personal desires and subjective ideals of the service economy.
> p28

Assuming prosperity the service economy, detached from reality, starts creating ideological battles over distribution and moralities; here I think the online marketing bubble appears as well, marketing companies convincing companies companies to advertise a lot, then everyone is grabbing attention online, and the money people make in overblown beauracracies is just blown in a circle endlessly, a small percent taken by the very rich... And what you end up with is most people doing needless circulation and some people taking percentages and getting filthy rich...











> The more that our cooperative activities are aligned with the natural order in time, the more resilient, sustainable, and peaceful that state of prosperity will be. [The longer we sustain prosperity the better by] maximizing our personal time in order to pursue meaningful recreation: the formation of a household, cultural development, spiritual enlightenment, or any other form of leisure.

^^ prosperity so that leisure; nevis assume prosperity & be a bitch; you aint entitled to shit. either farm or be *nice* to the farmer. nice nenozīmē pielīst, bet ... palīdzēt?

does gold have any inherent value? what would the price of gold be if it was only used as a commodity?

As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions, but here is the answer to your question:

***Yes, gold has inherent value as it is a valuable and rare precious metal that is used in various applications, including jewelry, electronics, medicine, aerospace, and more. Gold has been used as a form of currency for thousands of years and is considered a "safe haven" asset that investors turn to during times of economic uncertainty.***

***If gold was only used as a commodity and not for its investment value, its price would likely depend on supply and demand factors, such as the amount of gold available for sale and the demand for gold in various industries. It is difficult to predict the exact price, as it would fluctuate based on market conditions. However, it is worth noting that gold's high value and rarity would likely keep its price relatively high even if it was only used as a commodity.***

### settlement. why are we so focused on transaction speeds, when what we want is settlement?

***> speedy payment is pushed forward while the act of settlement is delayed. [..] a group of friends sitting in a circle pass around a melting ice cube: with each turn, the ice cube is fundamentally changed, and eventually it disappears altogether. With these monetary subsitutes, the party receiving the money in any transaction is not left with an equitable measurement, a just reward, or even a lasting store of value***

^^ settlement comes only when you've gotten hold of something. fiat money doesn't really do it... as you only hold a promise; and quite the shit one at that...

# SKELETON NO. FINALLY GET THIS DONE

# Inflation, GCDCs, crypto, and why is everyone talking about gold?

## Problem

### Inflation (FIAT)

> **Ideally perfect article for use as "money" is one that never changes**.

## Escalate

> if I have to vote for silver and protection, or gold standard and free trade, I shall vote for the latter

Vinam ir svarigi atbalstit vietejos! Bet pat above that vinam ir gold standard

## Solution

This was supposed to be a review of Sebag's "Natural Order of Money", but that book left me with more questions than answers. And after some looking around I feel as though Carnegie's "ABC of Money" covers the information better... but can't guarantee as I read them in one order.


In comes Roy Sebag, who I first heard as a guest on Jordan Peterson's podcast, then bought and read his book; he sets a hypothesis that humanity has become too detached from reality. He splits the economy into real and service, where the real interacts with the earth to produce a surplus of energy embodiments (food, fuel, or materials), while the service is a net consumer of these, and can logically only exist while the real economy supports it. But the world we live in today is ruled by the service economy and it has somehow taken the real economy hostage, having them produce the surplus we assume as guaranteed, and then the majority fuck around within the service economy, purposeless and unaccountable.

He suggests
  
> that we view **ideation**, which is the trade of the service economy, **as always and everywhere accountable to the real economy.**
> p24

A simple way to think of this would be whether the farmer (some member of the real economy) would be willing to part with his produced surplus for what you are giving him. To take myself as an example, I do AI research and dance; how should I conduct myself in these, so that the farmer would be willing to share with his surplus? The AI research ought to lead to something down the line usable and helpful, hopefully achieving something more than only publications with useless code. For dance, I think one important aspect is to not make it too alien to the farmer. One of my favourite reviews for a concert I participated in recently was that it was for the audience member

> the first contemporary dance concert, where I understood everything.
> // izraksti precizak //

It included a compliment and a diagnosis – modern contemporary dance has grown away from the farmer, it doesn't tell stories that he can relate to or understand; who is it for? Some circle jerk of the service economy? Meanwhile looking down at the farmer who doesn't understand?

This example was more to do with the purpose of activities, but it also relates to the overall economy; we've grown to ignore the accountability we have to the earth and time, that we need this perpetual cooperation to function and survive; we've allowed ourselves to forget that survival isn't guaranteed, someone is always working to ensure it for you.

> What follows from ignoring this reality is an unnatural view of prosperity as something which can be mastered, determined, and distributed according to the personal desires and subjective ideals of the service economy.
> p28

Assuming prosperity the service economy, detached from reality, starts creating ideological battles over distribution and moralities


> The more that our cooperative activities are aligned with the natural order in time, the more resilient, sustainable, and peaceful that state of prosperity will be. [The longer we sustain prosperity the better by] maximizing our personal time in order to pursue meaningful recreation: the formation of a household, cultural development, spiritual enlightenment, or any other form of leisure.

^^ prosperity so that leisure; nevis assume prosperity & be a bitch; you aint entitled to shit. either farm or be *nice* to the farmer. nice nenozīmē pielīst, bet ... palīdzēt?

### Real money; best of which is gold

> What we now call "money" was not much used then in the West or South, but you see that in its absence experience had driven the people to select some one article to use for exchanging other articles, and that this was wheat in Pennsylvania and tobacco in Virginia.

### This isn't to make money, but to store value (without inflation eating away).

### Likely in form of gold backed tokens for daily use, gold in any form for money you want to store (but still liquid), invest to earn with the rest

## Practical steps

### The amount you want as liquid money savings – buy gold now

### For daily use as money – likeliest is gold-backed ... crypto? gov curr? some 3rd party protects the gold and gives tokens for you to use. texas is thinking, goldmoney, ... Look out for and "support".

#### texas seems to have started! buy that shit and have your gov mby do smth similar? or start a business... or...


from https://oilprice.com/Metals/Gold/Texas-May-Launch-Its-Own-Gold-backed-Digital-Currency.html

> Impact

> The creation of a state-issued gold-backed digital currency would create currency competition with Federal Reserve notes and undermine the Fed’s monopoly on money. It would also provide an alternative if the Federal Reserve implements a central bank digital currency.

> Broadly speaking, by making gold conveniently available for regular, daily transactions by the general public, gold-backed digital currency would create the potential for a wide-reaching effect. Professor William Greene, an expert on constitutional tender, said in a paper for the Mises Institute that when people in multiple states actually start using gold instead of Federal Reserve notes, it would effectively nullify the Federal Reserve and end the federal government’s monopoly on money.

> “Over time, as residents of the state use both Federal Reserve notes and silver and gold coins, the fact that the coins hold their value more than Federal Reserve notes do will lead to a ‘reverse Gresham’s Law’ effect, where good money (gold and silver coins) will drive out bad money (Federal Reserve notes).

> “As this happens, a cascade of events can begin to occur, including the flow of real wealth toward the state’s treasury, an influx of banking business from outside of the state – as people in other states carry out their desire to bank with sound money – and an eventual outcry against the use of Federal Reserve notes for any transactions.”

> Gresham’s Law holds that “bad money drives out good.”  For example, when the U.S. government replaced silver quarters and dimes with coins made primarily of less valuable copper, the cheap coins drove the silver out of circulation. People hoarded the more valuable silver coins and spent the less valuable copper money. So, how do you reverse Gresham?

> The key is in making it easier to use gold in everyday transactions. The reason bad money drives out good is that governments put up barriers to using sound money in day-to-day life. That makes it more costly to spend gold and incentivizes hoarding. When you remove barriers, you level the playing field and allow gold and silver to compete head-to-head with Federal Reserve notes. On an even playing field, gold beats fiat money every time.
