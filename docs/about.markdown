Hi! My name is Pauli and this is a place for me to write. What about?

When I want to think deeply, I write and I post it here. External accountability is a great motivator to not be lazy and write your thoughts out clearly.

If a topic steals my attention and I fall into the deepest of rabbit holes, this is where I place what I've gathered; for safe keeping.

And... if ever I stumble across something which I deem needs to be shared, I might put it up here as well.

Welcome to the mystic magic wonderland of  
**PAULIS writes**
