<p>Hi! My name is Pauli and this is a place for me to write. What about?</p>

<p>When I want to think deeply, I write and I post it here. External accountability is a great motivator to not be lazy and write your thoughts out clearly.</p>

<p>If a topic steals my attention and I fall into the deepest of rabbit holes, this is where I place what I’ve gathered; for safe keeping.</p>

<p>And… if ever I stumble across something which I deem needs to be shared, I might put it up here as well.</p>

<p>Welcome to the mystic magic wonderland of<br />
